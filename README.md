# Anomaly-Detection-in-Videos
This project detects abnormal events in surveillance videos (e.g., theft, vandalism) using deep learning. It extracts spatiotemporal features with C3D and classifies them with an LSTM-based neural network. The system is optimized for binary classification (normal vs anomaly).
